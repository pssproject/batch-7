We here find the conflict, disagreement or mismatch of the secured information from the unstructured data by performing Text analyses and classification detect by using Machine Learning Model and identify which model will give high accuracy rate to identify the Cyber bullying activities, Fake News Identification and Spamming.

**Steps for execution of program:**

Step 1: Download the Source Code folder from github.

Step 2: Place all the source code in one folder.

Step 3: In path of source code folder in Command prompt install all the package required to run.

Step 4: Now open the Jupyter notebook by typing it on the source code folder, it will direct all the files to Jupyter Notebook IDE.

Step 5: Click Run -> Run All to run all the cell in the program.

Step 6: Output gets displayed after each cell and finds the accuracy rate for each model used. So we can predict the exact model by comparing the accuracy rate of all model and choose the model with high accuracy rate for identifiaction and detection of Cyber bullying activities, Fake News Identification and Spamming.
